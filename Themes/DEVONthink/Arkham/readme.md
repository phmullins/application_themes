# Arkham for DEVONthink 3

## Information

DEVONthink 3 is a knowledge-base application that allows you to store, sort, tag, and retrieve any kind of data that you can
think of. I personally like storing all of my text-based notes in DEVONthink as Markdown documents. You can specify a CSS file 
to be used to style the markdown. It's super easy to make your own too. Just grab this theme (CSS file) and hack it until you 
have something that you like. Good luck!
